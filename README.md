# Dotfiles

This is my dot files Github repository.
There are many like it, but this one is mine.
My dot files Github repository is my best friend.
It is my life.
I must master it as I must master my life.
My dot files Github repository, without me, is useless.
Without my dot files Github repository, I am useless.

There's no place like `~`.
